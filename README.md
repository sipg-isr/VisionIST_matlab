# MATLAB for VisionIST 

A MATLAB client for the [VisionIST](https://github.com/sipg-isr/VisionIST_Library) fleet. All box knowledge lives here, in MATLAB; One script per box and a Python script runs one generic bridge that knows no box.

```
visionist_run.py     the bridge: one Envelope in, one .mat out - the only
                     interpreter-agnostic piece, shared by both clients
README.md            this file

matlab/              the MATLAB client   (MATLAB strings)
octave/              the Octave client   (char and cellstr) - octave/README.md
```

Add one of the two to your path - never both, the function names are the same:

```matlab
addpath('matlab');    % or addpath('octave');
cfg = vsConfig();
```

Inside either folder:

```
vsConfig.m                hosts, interpreter, workdir, session id
vsRun.m                   the only function that launches Python
vsProbe.m  vsReset.m      reachability; clear a box or one session
vsHost.m   vsSet.m        small helpers

vsClip.m       vsD4rt.m       vsFeatures.m   vsLangSam.m
vsLightglue.m  vsMoge.m       vsOpenClip.m   vsOpencv.m
vsPycv.m       vsSbert.m      vsTapnext.m    vsUnimatch.m
vsVggt.m       vsYolo.m                      one per box

vsTrackStream.m           stream frames through lightglue, collect matches
vsObservation.m           match edges -> tracks -> observation matrix

visionist_walkthrough.m   the five demos, section by section
```

The Octave folder adds `vsChar.m` / `vsCellstr.m` (text normalisers),
`vsContainsAny.m` / `vsSplitLines.m` (two builtins Octave lacks) and
`vsSelfTest.m`, which checks the whole client against a stub bridge without a
fleet.

## The split

`visionist_run.py` takes a host, a JSON file holding the whole `config_json`,
and generic data flags:

```
--file FIELD=PATH     file bytes      (repeat the field to build a list)
--text FIELD=STRING   a literal string
--number FIELD=1.5    a number
```

It sends the Envelope, decodes the reply with whatever codec the box declared,
and writes every field into a `.mat`. It contains no box name, no command name
and no field name — adding a box never touches it.

Each `vs*` function holds one box's contract: its config section, its commands,
its parameters, the data fields it reads, and what the reply means. `help
vsYolo` (or any other) prints it.

```matlab
cfg = vsConfig();
cfg.session_id = "alice";

out = vsYolo(cfg, 'video', "clip.mp4", 'frame_step', 30, 'conf', 0.4);
d   = out.detections{2};         % struct: boxes, labels, scores, track_ids

out = vsMoge(cfg, 'images', ["a.jpg" "b.jpg"], 'fov_x', 60);
depth = out.results{1}.depth;    % H x W metres
```

## How replies land in the .mat

| the box returned | you get |
|---|---|
| numeric array | a numeric variable of the same name |
| torch tensor | numeric (needs `torch` on the Python side) |
| list of dicts | a cell array of structs: `results{1}.depth` |
| JSON object/list | numeric and char fields inside a struct, or `<field>_json` |
| one binary payload | written to disk, path in `<field>_file` |
| list of binaries | written to disk, paths in `<field>_files`, count in `<field>_count` |

Every reply also carries `config_json` (the box's own status section) and
`field_map_json` (original field name → the variable it became, for names
MATLAB cannot use verbatim).

## Adding a box

Copy `vsSbert.m` — the shortest one — change the section name, the parameters
and the documentation, and add the address to `cfg.hosts` in `vsConfig.m`.
Nothing on the Python side changes. Do it in **both** `matlab/` and `octave/`:
the two files differ only in how they spell text, so the second one is a short
edit of the first, and `octave/vsSelfTest.m` will tell you if the payload
drifted.

## Ports

`vsConfig` builds `cfg.hosts` from the registry's one port map. Every box has
a **permanent** host port, issued once in the order boxes arrived
(VisionIST_Library's `registry/ports.json`): `clip` 9061 … `sfm` 9074, and the
next new box takes 9075. Nothing already there ever moves, and a box answers
on the same port whether you booted the whole fleet or three of it — a partial
fleet has gaps, not renumbered boxes.

```matlab
cfg = vsConfig();                       % the permanent map
```

This replaces the old `'ports'` option, which chose between a "legacy" and a
"generated" convention that disagreed because the fleet generator used to
renumber alphabetically. Passing `'ports', "generated"` still runs, warns, and
gives you the same map.

**The fleet you are running is still the authority**: its
`docker-compose.yml` has the host ports and its `data/fleet.json` the
service-name addresses. Override any single one afterwards:

```matlab
cfg.hosts.d4rt = "ifetch.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt:9072";
```

## Three things that bite

**Indexing.** Arrays arrive exactly as the box produced them, so anything that
is an *index into another array* is 0-based and needs a `+1`. That is
`lightglue`'s `matches`. Coordinates are pixel positions and need no shift —
but `tapnext` reports `(y, x)` while the keypoint boxes report `(x, y)`.

**Sessions.** `cfg.session_id` keys `yolo`'s track ids, `tapnext`'s accumulated
tracks and the `lightglue` stream window. Re-calling with the same id
*continues* that session: `tapnext` returns every frame the session has ever
seen, not just the ones in your call. `vsReset(cfg, box, id)` starts clean —
and it knows the id goes at the top of the section for `yolo` and `tapnext`
but inside `parameters` for `lightglue`.

**Scale.** `vsD4rt` and `vsVggt` return geometry that is *up to scale*, not
metric — ratios and shapes mean something, absolute distances do not. Only
`vsMoge` gives metric depth. And `vsD4rt` has a hard clip length (48 frames
for the default checkpoint): ask about a later frame and upstream clamps the
timestep rather than refusing, so you get a confident wrong answer.

## Octave

Octave has no `string` class, so [`matlab/`](matlab) does not run there:
`"a" + ":" + "b"` becomes arithmetic on character codes and `["a" "b"]`
becomes one 1x4 char, both silently rather than with an error. That is why
there are two folders rather than one. [`octave/`](octave) holds the same
client rewritten in char/cellstr, with the same function names, arguments and
wire payloads.

```matlab
addpath('octave');          % that folder, not matlab/: the names collide
cfg = vsConfig();
vsSelfTest                  % 26 checks, no fleet needed
```

Differences are listed in [octave/README.md](octave/README.md); the short
version is that lists of text are `{'a.jpg', 'b.jpg'}` rather than
`["a.jpg" "b.jpg"]`, `vsProbe` and `vsOpenClip`'s model listing return struct
arrays instead of tables, and reading frames from a video needs `ffmpeg` on
PATH because Octave has no `VideoReader`. Those files also run under MATLAB,
so a script written against them works on both.

## Requirements

Python with `visionist-client`, `numpy`, `scipy` — plus `torch` for the boxes
that declare the torch codec (`clip`, `tapnext`, `textEmbedding`, `vggt`).
`open_clip` uses the numpy codec, so it does not need torch.
MATLAB with Image Processing Toolbox for the walkthrough's plotting.
